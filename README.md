# CollegeCodes
This is Created in Order to help the College Students to Get Codes of DSA 3rd Semester Btech RGPV Students to Write their C language Codes in Turbo C.
COPY PASTE IN TURBO C:

Commands for Turbo C:
To copy: Select the code using the mouse cursor. Press Ctrl + Ins.
To paste: Open the file where you want to paste the copied code. Press Shift + Ins.
To cut: Select the code using the mouse cursor. Press Shift + Del.
Method: 1
Select the code using the mouse cursor.
Press Ctrl + Ins to copy selected code.
Open the file where you want to paste the copied code.
Press Shift + Ins to paste the copied code on to the destination.

Method: 2 (Recommended)
If Above Doesn't Work then:(Recommmended)

CS303 DATA STRUCTURES


1. Review of C programming language.Introduction to Data Structure: Concepts of 
Data and Information, Classification of Data structures, Abstract Data Types, 
Implementation aspects: Memory representation. Data structures operations and 
its cost estimation. Introduction to linear data structures- Arrays, Linked List: 
Representation of linked list in memory, different implementation of linked list. 
Circular linked list, doubly linked list, etc. Application of linked list: polynomial 
manipulation using linked list, etc.
2. Stacks: Stacks as ADT, Different implementation of stack, multiple stacks.
Application of Stack: Conversion of infix to postfix notation using stack,
evaluation of postfix expression, Recursion. Queues: Queues as ADT, Different 
implementation of queue, Circular queue, Concept of Dqueue and Priority Queue, 
Queue simulation, Application of queues.
3. Tree: Definitions - Height, depth, order, degree etc. Binary Search Tree -
Operations, Traversal, Search. AVL Tree, Heap, Applications and comparison of 
various types of tree; Introduction to forest, multi-way Tree, B tree, B+ tree, B* 
tree and red-black tree.
4. Graphs: Introduction, Classification of graph: Directed and Undirected graphs,
etc, Representation, Graph Traversal: Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First
Search (BFS), Graph algorithm: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)- Kruskal, 
Prim‟s algorithms. Dijkstra‟s shortest path algorithm; Comparison between 
different graph algorithms. Application of graphs.
5. Sorting: Introduction, Sort methods like: Bubble Sort, Quick sort. Selection sort, 
Heap sort, Insertion sort, Shell sort, Merge sort and Radix sort; comparison of 
various sorting techniques. Searching: Basic Search Techniques: Sequential 
search, Binary search, Comparison of search methods. Hashing & Indexing. Case 
Study: Application of various data structures in operating system, DBMS etc.
