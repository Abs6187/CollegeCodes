## Introduction

Welcome to the SRIT College Campus Network Analysis and Cyber Security Project! This project aims to analyze and secure the network infrastructure of APSIT College using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project focuses on implementing security controls, such as VLANs, DHCP, RIP, VPN, and Firewalls, to enhance the security posture of the campus network.

## Requirements

To work on this project, you will need the following:

- Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your computer (download from the Cisco Networking Academy website).
- Basic understanding of networking concepts and protocols.

## Project Tasks

1. **Campus Network Analysis**: Begin by conducting an analysis of the existing APSIT College network topology, including the layout, devices, and connections.

2. **Network Mapping in Cisco Packet Tracer**: Use Cisco Packet Tracer to create a visual representation of the APSIT College network infrastructure, including routers, switches, and end devices.

3. **Creating Separate VLANs**: Configure separate VLANs on Layer 2 switches to segment the network and improve security.

4. **Multiswitch Access Point to All VLANs**: Enable communication between VLANs by configuring inter-VLAN routing on the Multilayer switch.

5. **Enabling Trunking on Links**: Configure trunking on the inter-switch links to carry multiple VLAN traffic over a single physical link.

6. **Configuring Main Campus Router for DHCP**: Set up DHCP pools on the Main Campus Router to provide automatic IP addressing to devices in different departments.

7. **Enabling RIP for Branch-to-Branch Communication**: Enable the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) on the Main Campus Router and Cloud Router for branch-to-branch communication.

8. **VPN Tunneling for Secure Communication**: Establish a VPN tunnel between the Main Campus Router and Cloud Router to ensure secure communication between different campuses.

9. **Firewall Configurations for FTP Server**: Set up firewall rules to protect the FTP server and allow specific access only to admin systems.

10. **Security Assessment Report**: Prepare a comprehensive security assessment report highlighting identified security risks, proposed solutions, and countermeasures to mitigate attack surface risks.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open Cisco Packet Tracer and load the provided network topology file.

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the "Project Manual" file to complete each task.

4. As you progress, use the "Network topology diagram" file to create a visual representation of the network infrastructure.

5. For each configuration task, use the provided commands in the "Project Manual" to set up VLANs, DHCP, RIP, VPN, and Firewall.

6. Test the network configurations and observe the effects on the network topology.
